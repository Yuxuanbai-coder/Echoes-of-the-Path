# Project Note

Some earlier commits stopped appearing on GitHub for unknown reasons during development.

No code was lost. To avoid further issues, the `main` branch was kept clean and stable, and the earlier commits were preserved in a separate backup branch:

archive-before-rebase

The `main` branch is the current working and submission branch.
